# Deep Clustering with Autoencoders

The unsupervised learning model of this assignment uses the autoencoders to and generative adversarial autoencoders to extract underlying features within a high dimensional data of the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. The resulting latent space of these autoencoders, being most representative of the data, is used to cluster data into their corresponding classes.
